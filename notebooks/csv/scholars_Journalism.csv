Journalist, Symposium Speaker. Public Health Specialist. Why health and science communication? Beyond telling stories, communication is vital for people and societies to improve and maintain their health.  	 I am a facilitator. I connect complex and difficult topics for many people to understand and help them see how science works for their health, how scientists improve their knowledge about the world around them.   I accompany people to take advantage of science based tools in favor of a better quality of life. I translate the implications behind the innovations.   It is not only journalism. Companies or organizations who work with health and science need assertive and strategic communication in order to connect with coworkers, clients, patients, members of an organization and society as whole.  Science is necessary for health decisions to be made with sustenance and have better results. Communication is my bridge to connect with people. I use simple words to translate the work of specialized entities whose language may be incomprehensible to broader audiences."
