Guidoâs work is animated by the conviction that the law should steer the development of technologies in a socially just, human-centric, and sustainable direction. Combining socio-legal methods and doctrinal private law approaches honed thanks to a PhD (Unipa), a postdoc (QMUL), and an HEA Fellowship, Guido has developed an expertise in IoT, machine learning, cloud computing, robotics, and blockchain. Their focus tends to be on the intellectual property, consumer protection, data governance, and human rights issues in these technologies. Guido is the author of Internet of Things and the Law: Legal Strategies for Consumer-Centric Technologies (Routledge 2022) and, building on some ideas developed in the book, they have been awarded a half-a-million grant by the Arts and Humanities Research Council and the German Research Foundation for the project âFrom Smart Technologies to Smart Consumer Laws. Comparative Perspectives from Germany and the UKâ (2022-2025). Outwith Stirling, Guido is working on the development of ethical guidelines on âEdAIâ as a member of the European Commissionâs Expert Group on AI and Data in Education and Training. Additionally, they are a Fellow of the Nexa Center for Internet and Society, a Research Associate at UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies, as well as the Co-Convenor of the Open Section of the Society of Legal Scholars, the oldest and largest society of law academics in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.",Yes
