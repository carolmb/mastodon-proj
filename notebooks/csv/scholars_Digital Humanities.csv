Recent essays include âToward a Diversity Stack: Digital Humanities and Diversity as Technical Problem."" A recent project he led was 4Humanities.org's ""WhatEvery1Says"" (WE1S), a digital humanities big-data initiative funded by the Mellon Foundation to understand public discourse about the humanities.

Currently, Alan is leading a small project team in creating an online âResearch + Activism (RAB) Bibliographyâ to showcase both âscholar activismâ and research by other actorsâincluding community organizations, NGOs, journalism organizations, artists, and othersâengaged with urgent social, cultural, political, environmental, and other problems. (Watch for the public launch of the RAB project soon.) In 2022-2023, Alan is chairing the Modern Language Associationâs Committee on Information Technology, which now is revising the MLAâs âGuidelines for Evaluating Work in Digital Humanities and Digital Mediaâ partly to encourage universities and colleges to support scholars working in new online forms capable of reaching the public."
