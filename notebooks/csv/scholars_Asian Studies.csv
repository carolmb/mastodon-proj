Chinese didn't arrive in significant numbers until the 1880s, some 30 years after Wong Ah Poo Hoc Ting (aka Appo Hocton) jumped ship in Nelson to become the first Chinese migrant to New Zealand, and only a few years after the Dunedin Chamber of Commerce invited Chinese miners to Otago. Early Chinese activity in Wellington historically centred around Haining Street and Frederick Street, and Sage's Lane, which was unofficially known as Wellington's Chinatown, or 'Tong Yan Gaai' (Chinese People's Street).  This wiki maps locations of significance to this community, and some of the history, organisations, businesses and people associated with them.  Although this wiki focuses on the greater Wellington area, there will be some content from further afield, which has a connection with the history of Chinese in Wellington, or may just be snippets of information that are of interest.",Yes,@WgtnChineseHist,https://cloudisland.nz/@WellingtonChineseHistory

I am also a scholar of modern Indonesia, and much of my research has revolved around Japanâs occupation of Indonesia in the Second World War as viewed and experienced by both Japanese and Indonesians, within a broader global context of interwar crisis.   In 2015 I also completed a major translation project of Professor Yoshimi Yoshiakiâs classic study Grassroots Fascism: The War Experience of the Japanese People (New York, Columbia University Press), supplementing the original with substantial new annotation and an extensive translatorâs introduction.  I am further interested in regional and global history (and the relationship between them) as well as broader questions and theories of nationalism and nation-building, fascism, Marxism and socialism, imperialism, colonialism and anti-colonialism, neo-colonialism and neo-imperialism, postcolonialism and postcolonial theory, race and race-thinking, history and memory, and historiography. My current project entitled Global Histories of WWII:  Imperial Crises and Contested Loyalties seeks to offer, in the form of an open-access publication and an associated website, a diverse assortment of fresh narratives and interpretations of the Second World War as a truly global (as opposed to Eurocentric) conflict.",Yes,@ethanmarkleiden,https://mastodon.online/@ethanmark
